# 1. Introduction to Docker

  - In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, compatibility issues between different environments often pose significant challenges for developers. Consider a scenario where you're tasked with running a Node.js application on your local machine. However, you encounter compatibility issues because the version of Node.js installed on your system differs from the one required by the application. This situation is not uncommon and can lead to frustrating roadblocks in the development process.
    
  - The problem arises when attempting to execute code that relies on specific runtime environments, libraries, or dependencies that are either missing or incompatible with the current system configuration. Incompatibility issues can manifest in various forms, including version discrepancies, conflicting dependencies, or differences in underlying operating systems.

  - Enter Docker – a powerful tool for containerization that provides a solution to these compatibility challenges. Docker allows developers to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers provide a consistent environment regardless of the underlying infrastructure, making it possible to run applications seamlessly across different systems.
    
  - In the context of our Node.js scenario, Docker enables us to create a containerized environment with the exact version of Node.js and any required dependencies. By defining a Dockerfile – a text document that contains instructions for building the Docker image – we can specify the desired Node.js version and any additional packages or configurations needed for our application.

  # What is Virtual Machine ?
  
  - A virtual machine or VM is a fully virtualized environment that runs on a physical machine. It runs its own operating system (OS) and benefits from the same equipment as a physical machine: CPU, RAM memory, hard drive and network card. Several virtual machines with different OS can coexist on the same physical server: Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.
  - The sharing of different virtual environments is managed by the hypervisor generally hosted in a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud. It performs resource partitioning and allocates a partition to each VM. This is done using software installed on the physical machine. In general, the latter has what is called a shared pool of physical resources.
   

  # What is Docker ?
  
  - Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment of applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight and portable environments that package an application and its dependencies, enabling it to run consistently across various computing environments, such as development, testing, and production.
  
  - Docker provides a standardized way to package, distribute, and manage applications, making it easier for developers to build, ship, and run their software across different systems and cloud environments. With Docker, developers can create containers containing all the necessary libraries, dependencies, and configurations needed to run their applications, without worrying about compatibility issues or differences in the underlying infrastructure.


  # Difference Between Docker Containers and Virtual Machines

  ![container-vs-vm](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/a8e7f3d5-7a87-41ce-a94b-1d9dd8b17366)

| Aspect                   | Docker Containers                                                                                                  | Virtual Machines (VMs)                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content                 | Contain binaries, libraries, and configuration files along with the application itself.                          | Each VM has its own copy of an operating system along with the application and necessary binaries.                      |
| Execution               | Run on a shared host operating system, utilizing the kernel of the underlying operating system.                   | Run on hypervisors, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single host machine.                                |
| Size and Resources      | Lightweight as they do not contain a guest OS for each container.                                                  | Larger as each VM has its own copy of an operating system, requiring more resources.                                    |
| Process Isolation       | OS-level process isolation.                                                                                        | Hardware-level process isolation.                                                                                       |
| Boot Time               | Quick boot time due to lightweight nature and resource sharing.                                                     | Slow boot time due to the need to boot up a complete operating system for each VM.                                       |

 # Docker Architecture:
   Docker uses a `client-server` architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

  ![docker-architecture](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/498bfc3e-ccfd-4570-81a0-58be4083f01c)

   - `Docker Client:` The Docker Client is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Docker Engine. Users can use commands such as docker build, docker run, docker pull, and docker push to build, run, and manage Docker containers.
   
   - `Docker Daemon:` The Docker Daemon is a background process that runs on the host machine and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests from the Docker Client and executes them.
   
   - `Docker Images:` Docker images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. They contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
   
   - `Docker Containers:` Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that run instances of applications. Each container is created from a Docker image and has its own filesystem, networking, and processes.
   
   - `Docker Registry:` Docker registries are repositories for storing and distributing Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but users can also set up private registries to store and share their own images.
   
   - `Docker Volumes:` Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by Docker containers. They provide a mechanism for storing and sharing data between containers and the host machine.
   
   - `Docker Networks:` Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other and with other network resources. They provide isolation and security by default, allowing users to define custom network configurations for their containers.

     

In Docker's client-server architecture, the process goes as follows:

  - `Docker client:` The process starts when the user uses the Docker client, which can be the Docker CLI command line or a Docker graphical user interface (GUI). The Docker client can be run on any Docker-enabled system, whether it is the same system as the Docker server or a remote system.
    
  - `Docker server:` Docker Server, also known as Docker Daemon, runs on a host system. It is the component responsible for managing Docker container operations. The Docker Daemon listens for requests from the Docker client.

  - `Client-server communication:` When the user sends a Docker command via the Docker client, it is transmitted to the Docker server via a communications protocol, often HTTPS or a Unix socket.
  - The Docker server receives the command, processes it, and returns the results to the Docker client.
  
  - `Operations management:`The Docker server handles operations such as building Docker images, starting and stopping containers, managing network and storage, etc.
  For example, if the user sends a command to run a container from a specific Docker image, the Docker server will check if the image is available locally. If it is not, it will download it from a Docker registry such as Docker Hub. Then it will create and start the container based on the parameters specified in the command.

  - `Response to client:` After the Docker server processes the command, it sends a response to the Docker client. This response may include information about the success or failure of the operation, additional details about the affected containers or images, etc.
