# 1. Introduction to Docker

 - In software development, compatibility issues often arise when running applications due to differences in runtime environments, `dependencies`, and system configurations.
 - For example, running a `Node.js` application locally may encounter problems if the installed Node.js version differs from the one required by the application.These issues stem from missing `dependencies`, conflicting `libraries`, or differences in underlying `operating systems`. 

![what-is-docker](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/e88adcee-0f8b-4914-ab35-96fd51e7e445)

  - Enter Docker â€“ It allows developers to package applications and dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistent execution across various systems.
  - Specifically in the Node.js scenario, Docker permits the creation of a containerized environment with the exact Node.js `version` and `dependencies` needed. By defining instructions in a `Dockerfile`, developers can specify the required environment and streamline development, mitigating compatibility issues and enhancing productivity.

  # What is Virtual Machine ?
  
  - A virtual machine or VM is a fully virtualized environment that runs on a physical machine. It runs its own operating system (OS) and benefits from the same equipment as a physical machine: CPU, RAM memory, hard drive and network card. Several virtual machines with different OS can coexist on the same physical server: Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.
  - The sharing of different virtual environments is managed by the hypervisor generally hosted in a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud. It performs resource partitioning and allocates a partition to each VM. This is done using software installed on the physical machine. In general, the latter has what is called a shared pool of physical resources.
   

  # What is Docker ?
  
  - Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment of applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight and portable environments that package an application and its dependencies, enabling it to run consistently across various computing environments, such as development, testing, and production.
  
  - Docker provides a standardized way to package, distribute, and manage applications, making it easier for developers to build, ship, and run their software across different systems and cloud environments. With Docker, developers can create containers containing all the necessary libraries, dependencies, and configurations needed to run their applications, without worrying about compatibility issues or differences in the underlying infrastructure.


  # Difference Between Docker Containers and Virtual Machines

| Aspect                   | Docker Containers                                                                                                  | Virtual Machines (VMs)                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content                 | Contain binaries, libraries, and configuration files along with the application itself.                          | Each VM has its own copy of an operating system along with the application and necessary binaries.                      |
| Execution               | Run on a shared host operating system, utilizing the kernel of the underlying operating system.                   | Run on hypervisors, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single host machine.                                |
| Size and Resources      | Lightweight as they do not contain a guest OS for each container.                                                  | Larger as each VM has its own copy of an operating system, requiring more resources.                                    |
| Process Isolation       | OS-level process isolation.                                                                                        | Hardware-level process isolation.                                                                                       |
| Boot Time               | Quick boot time due to lightweight nature and resource sharing.                                                     | Slow boot time due to the need to boot up a complete operating system for each VM.                                       |

 # Docker Architecture:
   Docker uses a `client-server` architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

  ![docker-architecture](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/498bfc3e-ccfd-4570-81a0-58be4083f01c)

   - `Docker Client:` The Docker Client is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Docker Engine. Users can use commands such as docker build, docker run, docker pull, and docker push to build, run, and manage Docker containers.
   
   - `Docker Daemon:` The Docker Daemon is a background process that runs on the host machine and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests from the Docker Client and executes them.
   
   - `Docker Images:` Docker images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. They contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
   
   - `Docker Containers:` Docker containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments that run instances of applications. Each container is created from a Docker image and has its own filesystem, networking, and processes.
   
   - `Docker Registry:` Docker registries are repositories for storing and distributing Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but users can also set up private registries to store and share their own images.
   
   - `Docker Volumes:` Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by Docker containers. They provide a mechanism for storing and sharing data between containers and the host machine.
   
   - `Docker Networks:` Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other and with other network resources. They provide isolation and security by default, allowing users to define custom network configurations for their containers.

     

In Docker's client-server architecture, the process goes as follows:

  - `Docker client:` The process starts when the user uses the Docker client, which can be the Docker CLI command line or a Docker graphical user interface (GUI). The Docker client can be run on any Docker-enabled system, whether it is the same system as the Docker server or a remote system.
    
  - `Docker server:` Docker Server, also known as Docker Daemon, runs on a host system. It is the component responsible for managing Docker container operations. The Docker Daemon listens for requests from the Docker client.

  - `Client-server communication:` When the user sends a Docker command via the Docker client, it is transmitted to the Docker server via a communications protocol, often HTTPS or a Unix socket.
  - The Docker server receives the command, processes it, and returns the results to the Docker client.
  
  - `Operations management:`The Docker server handles operations such as building Docker images, starting and stopping containers, managing network and storage, etc.
  For example, if the user sends a command to run a container from a specific Docker image, the Docker server will check if the image is available locally. If it is not, it will download it from a Docker registry such as Docker Hub. Then it will create and start the container based on the parameters specified in the command.

  - `Response to client:` After the Docker server processes the command, it sends a response to the Docker client. This response may include information about the success or failure of the operation, additional details about the affected containers or images, etc.

# 3. Docker Concepts

   # Docker Images 
   - A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to `run` a piece of software, including the `code`, `runtime`, `libraries`, `environment variables`, and `configuration files`. It's essentially a snapshot of a Docker container. Docker images are built using a `Dockerfile` and can be stored in `registries`, such as `Docker Hub` or a private registry, for easy distribution and sharing among developers and systems.
   -  It's important to note that Docker images are `immutable`, meaning they do not change once created. To introduce changes, a new image needs to be created based on the desired modifications.
 
 ![docker-images](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/0ebcd5e5-b17a-4fca-9cd6-f621ae7ff3e7)
 
 # Docker Containers
 - A Docker container is a runtime `instance` of a Docker image. It encapsulates an application along with its dependencies and runs in isolated environments called containers.

    ![docker-containers](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/28c4b633-971a-472e-8141-d7fc907b60ca)
 
 - Containers are lightweight, portable, and provide consistent environments across different deployment environments, ensuring that applications run consistently regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
 -  `Multiple containers` can run on the `same host` without interfering with each other, making them an ideal choice for microservices architectures and containerized applications.

   ![docker-containers2](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/b9277bc8-c654-4e3f-9a23-732e8b029856)

  # Parent Images

- In Docker, a parent image is an image from which another image is created. Each `Docker image` is made up of `layers`, which are `read-only` layers stacked on top of each other to form the complete image. These layers are created from the `Dockerfile` instructions when building the image.
  
  ![parent-image](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/0f17b1a5-0fc9-469d-8b24-c64ad0f9369f)

- Parent images can be official images provided by Docker, such as those for popular programming languages like Python or Node.js, or they can be custom images created by users or organizations. These parent images often come pre-installed with certain dependencies, libraries, or configurations specific to a particular runtime environment.
  
  ![parent-image2](https://github.com/douaeelh2/Docker-Documentation/assets/127549220/f1906606-5fdc-4919-b6f9-c4587f9b7abb)

- Here are some examples of commonly used parent images in Docker:
   - `Python:` Used for Python applications, e.g., `python:3.8`, `python:3.9-alpine`.
   - `Node.js:` For Node.js applications, e.g., `node:14`, `node:alpine`.
   - `MySQL:` Database server, e.g., `mysql:8.0`.
     
   # Dockerfile
   - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of `instructions` used to build a `Docker image`. A Docker image is a lightweight, portable package that contains everything needed to run an application, including `code`, `libraries`, `dependencies`, and `environment variables`.
   
   - The Dockerfile defines the environment in which an application will run inside a Docker container. It specifies the steps needed to create the Docker image, such as which base to use, which `dependencies to install`, which `files to add`, which `commands to run`, etc.
   
   - Once the Dockerfile is written, it is used with the `docker build` command to build the Docker image. Once the image is created, it can be used to run containers, which are running instances of that image.
   - Here are Dockerfile examples for a React application and a Spring Boot application:

     ### Dockerfile for a React application
     
     ```dockerfile
       # Use a Node.js image as the base
       FROM node:14-alpine
       
       # Set the working directory inside the container
       WORKDIR /app
       
       # Copy files from the host's current directory into the container
       COPY . .
       
       # Install dependencies
       RUN npm install
       
       # Build the React application
       RUN npm run build
       
       # Default command to run the application when a container starts
       CMD ["npm", "start"]
     ```
