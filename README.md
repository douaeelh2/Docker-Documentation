# 1. Introduction to Docker

  - In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, compatibility issues between different environments often pose significant challenges for developers. Consider a scenario where you're tasked with running a Node.js application on your local machine. However, you encounter compatibility issues because the version of Node.js installed on your system differs from the one required by the application. This situation is not uncommon and can lead to frustrating roadblocks in the development process.
    
  - The problem arises when attempting to execute code that relies on specific runtime environments, libraries, or dependencies that are either missing or incompatible with the current system configuration. Incompatibility issues can manifest in various forms, including version discrepancies, conflicting dependencies, or differences in underlying operating systems.
    
  - Enter Docker – a powerful tool for containerization that provides a solution to these compatibility challenges. Docker allows developers to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers provide a consistent environment regardless of the underlying infrastructure, making it possible to run applications seamlessly across different systems.
    
  - In the context of our Node.js scenario, Docker enables us to create a containerized environment with the exact version of Node.js and any required dependencies. By defining a Dockerfile – a text document that contains instructions for building the Docker image – we can specify the desired Node.js version and any additional packages or configurations needed for our application.

  # What is Virtual Machine ?
  
  - A virtual machine or VM is a fully virtualized environment that runs on a physical machine. It runs its own operating system (OS) and benefits from the same equipment as a physical machine: CPU, RAM memory, hard drive and network card. Several virtual machines with different OS can coexist on the same physical server: Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.
  - The sharing of different virtual environments is managed by the hypervisor generally hosted in a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud. It performs resource partitioning and allocates a partition to each VM. This is done using software installed on the physical machine. In general, the latter has what is called a shared pool of physical resources.
   

  # What is Docker ?
  
  - Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment of applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight and portable environments that package an application and its dependencies, enabling it to run consistently across various computing environments, such as development, testing, and production.
  
  - Docker provides a standardized way to package, distribute, and manage applications, making it easier for developers to build, ship, and run their software across different systems and cloud environments. With Docker, developers can create containers containing all the necessary libraries, dependencies, and configurations needed to run their applications, without worrying about compatibility issues or differences in the underlying infrastructure.


  # Difference Between Docker Containers and Virtual Machines

| Aspect                   | Docker Containers                                                                                                  | Virtual Machines (VMs)                                                                                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content                 | Contain binaries, libraries, and configuration files along with the application itself.                          | Each VM has its own copy of an operating system along with the application and necessary binaries.                      |
| Execution               | Run on a shared host operating system, utilizing the kernel of the underlying operating system.                   | Run on hypervisors, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single host machine.                                |
| Size and Resources      | Lightweight as they do not contain a guest OS for each container.                                                  | Larger as each VM has its own copy of an operating system, requiring more resources.                                    |
| Process Isolation       | OS-level process isolation.                                                                                        | Hardware-level process isolation.                                                                                       |
| Boot Time               | Quick boot time due to lightweight nature and resource sharing.                                                     | Slow boot time due to the need to boot up a complete operating system for each VM.                                       |
